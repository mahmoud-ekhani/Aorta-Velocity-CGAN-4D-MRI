# Aorta-Velocity-CGAN-4D-MRI
A GitHub repository with Jupyter notebooks for training &amp; testing a CGAN to transform the anatomy of the aorta &amp; velocity metrics from 4D flow MRI using deep learning techniques. Ideal for medical imaging researchers &amp; practitioners

This GitHub repository contains Jupyter notebooks for training and testing a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) designed to perform the transformation between the anatomy of the aorta and velocity metrics obtained through 4D flow MRI. The CGAN utilizes deep learning techniques to learn the mapping between these two domains, making it a useful tool for researchers and practitioners in the medical imaging field.
